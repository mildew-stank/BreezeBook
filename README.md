# About
This is a maritime logbook and navigation aid, made for Android with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It uses [Ramani-Maps](https://github.com/ramani-maps/ramani-maps) and [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data.

# Usage
Track coordinates, heading, speed, distance traveled, and UTC at a glance on the dashboard. Open the log to add it all to the book, and export to csv when the voyage is through. Have a look at the chart to see all your logs pinned to the world map.

For phones with a pressure sensor, there will also be a barometer on the dashboard. Tap it to open the pressure log. If the app is open and there hasn't been an entry in the last 30 minutes one will be added automatically.

Works completely offline with no need for additional caching, but it will not display dynamic hazards, docks, forecasts or tides.
